Custom Settings and Hooks
Permission Classes:
IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly is used in views like BookListView and BookDetailView to allow read-only access for unauthenticated users and full access for authenticated users.
IsAuthenticated is used in views like BookCreateView, BookUpdateView, and BookDeleteView to ensure only authenticated users can create, update, or delete books.
Custom Behavior:
The BookCreateView uses the BookSerializer for validating and creating new books.
The BookUpdateView similarly uses BookSerializer to validate and update the existing books.
The BookDeleteView deletes the book using the provided pk and is protected by authentication.
